PizzaBox
========

PizzaBox is an application I'm dreaming up 1) to teach myself some Ruby and
2) to practice on building things made up of nice, loosely coupled components
that play well.

This application should provide at least a decent simulation of what a pizza
restaurant needs to operate, including taking orders and tracking, managing
customer contact information, routing of orders for delivery drivers, POS
functionality, the makeline, inventory, and some basic reporting.

Some of these parts will be only very stubby at first.  I want order-taking
and the makeline to be the first reasonably fully working things.  Before even
that, however, must come a good schema design for the database and some architecture decisions.
