Installation
============

There's database setup, and there's app installation.


Database setup
--------------

TODO WRITEME


App installation
----------------

Some day there will be a higher-level way to set this up, like distro packages.

As root, run

# ruby setup.rb

There are tools that would allow you to build a basic .rpm or .deb
around this.  Otherwise, note that building this way doesn't give
you an easy way to uninstall.
